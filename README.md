# Repository for Personal Studies

Here I store some codes I've seen on Youtube/Instagram. I organize them in branches.

Branches:  
==> tabela-responsiva-JS_DOM
studies in a responsible table for an online chart in an e-commerce business. Manipulation with JavaScript, styling in CSS using the international standard BEM

==> header-responsivo-semJS
responsive header with no JavaScript

==> layout-flexbox-responsivo
common layout of webpage using flexbox for responsiveness
